This is the main workbook where all the data and functionality is managed. It includes:

    Inventory recording with buttons for easy adjustments (requires macros to be enabled).
    Pivot tables to analyze data, such as order replenishment recommendations.

Make sure to enable macros when opening to ensure buttons and automated fields work properly.
